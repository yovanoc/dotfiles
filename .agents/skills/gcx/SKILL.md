# gcx — Grafana Cloud CLI

gcx is a unified CLI for Grafana Cloud, organized like kubectl: named contexts,
structured output, and a consistent verb model across all resource types.

## Discover Before You Act

gcx has a built-in command catalog. Never guess a command — discover it first.
Use **progressive disclosure** to minimize token cost:

**Step 1 — Orient** (30 lines, all top-level groups):
```bash
gcx help-tree --depth 1 -o text
```

**Step 2 — Drill down** (5-20 lines per group):
```bash
gcx help-tree <group> -o text      # full subtree for one group
gcx <group> <subcommand> --help    # exact flags and args
```

**Build payloads:**
```bash
gcx resources list-types <kind>     # resource types + JSON schema for a type
gcx resources list-examples <kind>  # example manifest
```

Only fall back to `gcx commands --flat -o json` when you need structured metadata
for automation - the output is hundreds of kilobytes and unsuitable for orientation.

### Intent-to-Group Quick Reference

When you already know the user's intent, skip discovery and go straight to the
right group:

| Intent | Group | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Dashboards, folders, K8s resources | `resources` | `gcx resources get dashboards` |
| SLO definitions and reports | `slo` | `gcx slo definitions list` |
| Alert rule status, notification settings | `alert` | `gcx alert rules list` |
| Create/modify/delete alert rules | `resources` | `gcx resources pull alertrules -p ./rules`, edit, `gcx resources push -p ./rules` |
| Datasource-managed (Mimir/Loki ruler) rules | `alert ruler` | `gcx alert ruler groups list --datasource <uid>` |
| Synthetic Monitoring checks | `synthetic-monitoring` | `gcx synthetic-monitoring checks list` |
| IRM (OnCall + Incidents) | `irm` | `gcx irm oncall schedules list`, `gcx irm incidents list` |
| k6 load tests, projects, runs | `k6` | `gcx k6 load-tests list` |
| PromQL / Adaptive Metrics | `metrics` | `gcx metrics query -d <uid> 'up'` |
| LogQL / Adaptive Logs | `logs` | `gcx logs query -d <uid> '{app="foo"}'` |
| Profiling (Pyroscope) | `profiles` | `gcx profiles query` |
| Tracing (Tempo) | `traces` | `gcx traces query -d <uid> '{ status = error }'` (see Tempo LLM-friendly output below) |
| Datasource info and queries | `datasources` | `gcx datasources list` |
| Fleet pipelines, collectors | `fleet` | `gcx fleet pipelines list` |
| Knowledge Graph (Asserts) | `kg` | `gcx kg entities list` |
| Frontend Observability | `frontend` | `gcx frontend apps list` |
| App Observability | `appo11y` | `gcx appo11y overrides get` |

If no command exists for the requested operation, say so and propose the nearest
supported flow.

### Avoid Raw API Passthrough

**Do not use `gcx api`** when a dedicated command exists. `gcx api` is a low-level
fallback for endpoints not yet covered by dedicated commands. Dedicated commands
provide proper output formatting, pagination, error handling, and token-efficient
output. Check the intent-to-group table above first.

Similarly, prefer `gcx metrics query` over `gcx datasources query <prometheus-uid>`
for PromQL queries — the signal-specific command handles datasource resolution
automatically.

## Verify Context First

Before any operation, confirm which environment is targeted:
- `gcx config check` — validates the active context and tests connectivity
- `gcx config view` — shows full config (secrets redacted; use `--raw` to reveal)
- `gcx config current-context` — shows just the active context name
- `gcx config use-context <name>` — switch contexts
- `--context <name>` flag on any command — target a specific context without switching

## Output Control

| Intent | Flag |
|--------|------|
| Structured output for parsing | `-o json` |
| Field selection | `--json <field1,field2>` (use `--json list` or `--json ?` to discover fields) |
| Full table output (no truncation) | `--no-truncate` |
| YAML output | `-o yaml` |
| Wide table with extra columns | `-o wide` |

Default to `-o json` when working programmatically.

## Safe Mutation Workflow

Follow this sequence for any change. Skip steps only when the user explicitly
asks for speed.

1. **Verify context** — confirm which environment is targeted
2. **Read current state** — list or get the resource first
3. **Build from template** — use list-types/list-examples output, not hand-crafted payloads
4. **Preview** — use `--dry-run` where available before applying
5. **Apply** — create, update, or delete
6. **Verify** — re-read the resource to confirm the change landed

## Key Flags for Operations

| Intent | Flag |
|--------|------|
| Preview without changing anything | `--dry-run` |
| Target a specific context | `--context <name>` |
| Continue on errors vs stop | `--on-error fail\|ignore\|abort` |
| Control concurrency | `--max-concurrent <n>` (default 10) |

## Resource Operations

The `gcx resources` group handles CRUD for Grafana's K8s-tier resources:
- `get` — list or fetch resources
- `push` — create or update from local files
- `pull` — export resources to local files
- `delete` — remove resources
- `edit` — edit resources interactively
- `validate` — validate local files against a live instance
- `list-types` — discover available resource types and their schemas
- `list-examples` — list example manifests for resource types

All resource commands accept selectors: `gcx resources get dashboards`,
`gcx resources get dashboards/my-dash`, `gcx resources get dashboards folders`.

## Datasource Queries

The `gcx datasources` group provides typed query interfaces:
- `list` / `get` — discover available datasources (`get -o yaml` emits an apply-ready manifest)
- `prometheus` — PromQL queries (query, labels, metadata, targets)
- `loki` — LogQL queries (query, labels, series)
- `pyroscope` — profiling queries
- `tempo` — trace queries
- `generic` — auto-detect datasource type

Use `gcx datasources <type> --help` to discover type-specific flags.

### Datasource lifecycle (declarative CRUD)

Manage datasource instances with Kubernetes-style manifests (file or stdin):
- `create -f FILE` / `update UID -f FILE` — apply a manifest; `--dry-run` previews
  a secret-redacted diff. Secrets go in the top-level `secure` block via
  `{create: <value>}`, `{fromEnv: <VAR>}`, or `{fromFile: <path>}` — never on argv.
- `delete UID...` — prompts unless `--force`/`--yes` (auto-approved in agent mode);
  batch-safe with partial-failure exit code 4.
- `health [UID]` — exit 0 healthy, 4 unhealthy (resource failure), 1/2/3 command failure.
- `schemas get --type <plugin>` — plugin configuration schema (when the server
  serves the datasource app-platform API).

Custom HTTP headers use the flat convention: name in `jsonData.httpHeaderName{N}`,
value (secret) in `secure.httpHeaderValue{N}`.

### Tempo LLM-friendly output for agents

When fetching Tempo tag values or full trace bodies for this agent to inspect,
summarize, debug, or include in a prompt, prefer Tempo's compact LLM-friendly
encoding:

```bash
# Attribute values grouped by type instead of repeated {type,value} objects.
gcx traces tags -d <tempo-uid> -l resource.service.name --llm -o json

# Full trace body in Tempo's LLM-friendly trace encoding.
gcx traces get -d <tempo-uid> <trace-id> --llm -o json
# equivalent legacy path:
gcx datasources tempo get -d <tempo-uid> <trace-id> --llm -o json
```

Use `gcx traces labels -d <tempo-uid>` to discover attribute names first. Use
`gcx traces query` to find trace IDs, then `gcx traces get --llm -o json` to inspect
a selected trace. Omit `--llm` only when the user explicitly needs raw Tempo/OTLP
JSON or the standard `tagValues: [{type, value}]` shape for schema/debugging work.

## Grafana Assistant

gcx provides direct access to the Grafana Assistant — use it for **reasoning
and exploration**, not data retrieval. Deterministic commands are faster and
cheaper for known queries; the Assistant adds value when you need intelligence.

| Situation | Use | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| You know the exact query | Deterministic command | `gcx metrics query 'rate(http_requests_total[5m])'` |
| You don't know which metrics/labels exist | `gcx assistant prompt` | `"What metrics exist for the checkout service?"` |
| You need cross-signal root cause analysis | `gcx assistant investigations` | Multi-agent parallel exploration across metrics, logs, traces, profiles |
| You need a precise, repeatable data point | Deterministic command | `gcx slo definitions status`, `gcx alert instances list --state firing` |
| You need to understand service dependencies | `gcx assistant prompt` | `"How are services in namespace X connected?"` — Assistant Memories know your stack topology |

### Commands

```bash
# Ask a question (Assistant uses Infrastructure Memories for context)
gcx assistant prompt "What services are unhealthy in namespace checkout?"

# Follow up on the previous conversation
gcx assistant prompt "Dig into the database connection issue" --continue

# Launch a deep investigation (multi-agent, parallel signal exploration)
gcx assistant investigations create --title="Checkout latency spike"

# Monitor and read results
gcx assistant investigations get <id>
gcx assistant investigations get-narrative <id>
```

### Recommended Workflow: Interleave Both

1. **Detect** with deterministic commands — `gcx alert instances list --state firing`
2. **Understand** with the Assistant — `gcx assistant prompt "Why is checkout-latency firing?"`
3. **Investigate** if needed — `gcx assistant investigations create --title="..."`
4. **Verify fix** with deterministic commands — `gcx slo definitions status <uuid>`

## Provider Commands

Product-specific providers register their own top-level command groups.
Discover them with `gcx providers`, then explore with `gcx <provider> --help`.

Each provider adds domain-specific subcommands for managing that product's
resources. The set of providers grows over time — always discover rather than
hardcode.

## Parallelism

gcx commands are stateless API calls. When multiple operations are independent
(no output dependency between them), issue them as parallel Bash tool calls in
a single message. This applies to:

- Multiple list/get calls across different resource types
- Multiple schema/example fetches
- Independent create/update operations
- Concurrent datasource queries

Only sequence commands when a later call needs output from an earlier one.

## Secret Safety

Never read raw config files — they contain plaintext tokens. Use `gcx config view`
(which redacts secrets) for inspection. When passing tokens to external tools,
use shell variables rather than inline values.
