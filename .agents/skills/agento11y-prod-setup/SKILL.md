  Sets up production evaluation and guardrails for a DEPLOYED AI agent in Grafana
  Agent Observability, grounded in the agent's own code and its real ingested traffic.
  The judgment layer on top of the `agento11y` skill: it reads the agent's source
  (system prompt, tools, entrypoint) AND samples its live traffic via gcx, checks
  what evaluators/rules/guards already exist, then recommends only what's missing —
  online eval rules (score live conversations for regressions) and guards (warn-first
  request-path policies that redact / tool-filter and may later be promoted to deny).
  It drafts reviewable YAML and, only with explicit confirmation, applies via
  `gcx agento11y`. New guards start disabled + warn. It DOES create stack-level objects —
  that is the point — but every write is confirmed. It never rewrites or redeploys the
  agent. Trigger on phrases like "set up production evaluation", "my agent is in prod
  what should I evaluate", "catch quality regressions", "add guardrails to my agent",
  "redact PII from my agent", "block dangerous tools", "set up online evals and guards".

# Agent Observability — production evals & guards setup

The production counterpart to `agento11y-test-starter` (which runs pre-ship, on code alone,
producing an offline test suite). This skill runs **after** ship, when the agent has real
traffic, and sets up the two production surfaces the starter deliberately leaves out:

- **Online eval rules** — evaluators that score ingested live conversations, so regressions
  surface without hand-reviewing every conversation.
- **Guards** (hook-rules) — policies on the request path that `warn`, redact (`transform`), or
  block tools (`tool_filter`) in real time, and can later be promoted to `deny`.

## What this skill does that `agento11y` doesn't

The sibling `agento11y` skill is the **mechanics** layer: exact CLI flags, evaluator/rule YAML
shapes, create-or-update semantics, the online-eval setup steps. It assumes you already know
*what* to create.

This skill is the **judgment** layer. It answers *which* rules and guards this specific agent
needs, by grounding in two evidence sources a generic checklist can't use:

1. **The agent's code** — its system prompt, tools, and how it handles user data. Half the value
   is here; read and cite it (`file:line`).
2. **The agent's real traffic** — because it's deployed, you can see what it actually does in
   prod, not just what the code says it might.

Two gaps this skill fills beyond `agento11y`:

- **Recommendation from evidence** — `agento11y` starts once you know what to create; this decides.
- **Guards** — `agento11y` documents evaluators and rules but not guards (hook-rules), even though
  `gcx agento11y guards` exists. This skill carries the guard shapes
  (`transform` / `tool_filter` / `action_on_fail`) itself.

For any mechanical detail — exact flags, evaluator/rule YAML fields, the setup flow — defer to
the `agento11y` skill and to `gcx agento11y <sub> --help` rather than restating it here.

## Rules

- Every connection to the stack goes through **`gcx agento11y`** — never raw HTTP, never a hand-held
  token. `gcx` owns Cloud auth (via `gcx login`). Prerequisite: `gcx` installed and authenticated;
  if it isn't, say so and stop.
- **Confirm the target stack before any WRITE (Step 0 + Step 5).** Reads run freely once you've
  shown the context; writes (upsert evaluators, create/update rules and guards) need an explicit yes on the
  target stack. `gcx` may be pointed at the wrong stack, and this skill creates stack-level
  objects.
- **Check before recommending.** Always list what already exists first
  (`gcx agento11y evaluators list`, `rules list`, `guards list`) and never recommend a duplicate.
  Compare by **semantic equivalence**, not just id/name — see Step 2.
- This skill **does** create stack-level objects — that is its job, the one thing that separates
  it from `agento11y-test-starter`. But every creation is **explicit and confirmed**: show the exact
  YAML, get a yes, then create it with the matching `gcx agento11y` command. A yes for one object
  is not a yes for the next.
- New guards are always drafted **`enabled: false`** and **`action_on_fail: "warn"`** — even
  hard-policy ones. Never draft a first-time `deny` guard, and never ship one enabled: a false
  positive blocks real users. The developer flips to `deny` + enabled themselves, later, after
  watching it in warn mode (Step 6).
- New online rules start with a **conservative `sample_rate`** (e.g. `0.1`), not `1.0` — an
  `llm_judge` over 100% of traffic costs real money.
- Prefer **starting from an evaluator template** (`gcx agento11y templates list`, then
  `gcx agento11y templates get`) over authoring
  a new evaluator. Only write a fresh one when nothing fits.
- Do not rewrite the agent's prompt, optimize, or redeploy. This skill configures observation and
  guardrails around the agent, not the agent itself.
- If a required input is missing (the agent's name as Agent Observability sees it, or `gcx` auth),
  ask — don't guess.

## Step 0 — Confirm the target stack

Before reading traffic or writing anything, show the developer where `gcx` is pointed. The active
context may not be the stack they think:

```
gcx config current-context        # the active context name
gcx config view                   # its server URL, org-id, auth method
```

Display the resolved **context name, server URL, and org-id**. Two thresholds:

- **Before reads** (traffic sampling, inventory): show the resolved context so the developer sees
  where the discovery ran. A wrong stack here wastes effort but doesn't change anything.
- **Before any write** (Step 5): require an **explicit yes** that this is the intended production
  stack. Writes are what create stack-level objects, so this confirmation is the hard gate.

If it's wrong, stop — the developer switches with `gcx config use-context <name>`, or you pass
`--context <name>` on every `gcx` call. (Watch for `localhost` / dev-looking servers — a strong
sign the active context is not their prod stack.)

## Step 1 — Read the code and sample real traffic

Two evidence sources. Do both; every later recommendation cites one of them.

**Code** (as `agento11y-test-starter` Step 1). Find and record file:line for: the entrypoint, the
system prompt, the tool/function definitions, and how it handles user data. This tells you what
*could* go wrong. **The code is the authoritative source for the system prompt and tools** —
content capture is often off in production, so the ingested traffic frequently has an empty
`system_prompt` and may omit tool definitions. Never conclude "this agent has no system prompt"
from the traffic; read it from the code.

**Traffic**, via `gcx` — this tells you what *does* go wrong:

1. Find the agent as Agent Observability sees it: `gcx agento11y agents list` (and `agents get` /
   `agents list-versions`) to get the exact `agent_name` — this is the `match.agent_name` you'll target. (Tip:
   `agents list` prints a leading hint line before the JSON; set `GCX_AGENT_MODE=true` or skip
   that line if you parse it.)
2. Sample recent conversations: `gcx agento11y conversations search --filters 'agent = "<name>"'`
   (add `status = "error"`, time windows, `tool.name`, `eval.passed = false`) and
   `gcx agento11y generations get <id>` for detail. Look for long tool loops, over-refusals, PII
   echoed back, off-topic drift, malformed outputs, error clusters.
   - **Some agents have generations but no conversations** (e.g. single-shot agents whose spans
     aren't grouped into a conversation). If `conversations search` returns empty but `agents get`
     shows a non-zero `generation_count`, don't stop — sample generations directly
     (`gcx agento11y generations get <id>`) and use `selector: all_assistant_generations` for rules
     rather than a conversation-scoped one.

**Minimum evidence bar.** Aim for **≥20 recent conversations over ≥7 days** before drafting
anything. Fewer than that and you risk overfitting one odd conversation into a production rule or
guard: if the window is thin, either stop and say so, or proceed but mark every recommendation
**low-confidence** and lean on drafts (disabled guards, low `sample_rate`) rather than anything
that intervenes. A recommendation from a single conversation is a hypothesis, not a rule. If the
agent has essentially no traffic, stop — this is the wrong skill; `agento11y-test-starter` (offline
suite) is the right one until traffic exists.

## Step 2 — Inventory what already exists

Before proposing anything: `gcx agento11y evaluators list`, `gcx agento11y rules list`,
`gcx agento11y guards list` (add `-o yaml` to see full definitions). For each concern you're about to
raise, decide whether something already covers it — by **semantic equivalence, not id or name**.
Two objects are effectively the same when they share:

- the same **surface** (both rules, or both guards),
- the same **target** (overlapping `match`, especially `agent_name` / `selector`),
- the same **intent** (evaluator kind + what it checks, or the guard's policy),
- the same **action** (rule scoring vs. guard `warn`/`deny`/`transform`/`tool_filter`).

If an existing object matches on those, don't create a second one — say it's covered and stop, or
propose an `update` to the existing one. A different id over identical intent+target+action is a
duplicate, and duplicate guards/rules double cost and can conflict.

## Step 3 — Recommend rules and guards

Map each observation to the surface that fits. **Online rules** *observe* (score, detect
regressions, no user impact, **no agent code change** — the eval worker scores ingested traffic
asynchronously); **guards** *intervene* (block/redact on the live request path, **and require a
code change in the agent to call them — see Step 5.5**). Pick the surface by whether you want to
watch or to stop — and remember a guard is dead config until the agent is wired to it.

| If, in code or traffic, the agent… | Surface | Shape (prefer a predefined template) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gives answers whose quality can drift | online **rule** | fork `template.helpfulness` / `template.relevance` (`llm_judge`) over `user_visible_turn` |
| does RAG / cites sources | online **rule** | fork `template.groundedness` (`llm_judge`) |
| must emit JSON / a fixed shape | online **rule** | fork `template.json_valid` (`json_schema`) |
| over-refuses or drifts off-topic | online **rule** | `regex` / `llm_judge` on `all_assistant_generations` |
| public-facing text | online **rule** | fork `template.toxicity` / `template.pii` (`llm_judge`) |
| echoes user data with PII/secrets | **guard** | `transform` (regex → `[REDACTED:...]`) |
| can call dangerous tools (shell, delete, write) | **guard** | `tool_filter` with `blocked_names` globs (e.g. `Bash(*rm*)`) |
| is subject to prompt-injection / hard policy | **guard** | `llm_judge` evaluator; draft `warn`, later promotable to `deny` |

Template ids above are the **expected** global blueprints — they can vary by deployment and
version, so always resolve the current set with `gcx agento11y templates list` before using a name;
don't trust a hardcoded id. Pick 3–6, ranked. Each gets a one-line `why` citing a **file:line or a
conversation/generation id** from Step 1. For rule mechanics (selectors, match keys, evaluator
kinds, templates), the `agento11y` skill is the reference — don't restate it here.

**Every candidate lands in exactly one of three states — and the decision is final for this run:**

- **Recommended** — worth setting up now; goes to Step 4 (draft) and Step 5 (apply).
- **Considered, not recommended** — you evaluated it and it's not worth it (low value, no
  evidence, would just add cost/noise). Record it with a one-line why, and **do NOT draft or apply
  it**. Don't quietly re-add it later under a different framing — if you're tempted to, it belongs
  in Recommended, so put it there and own the reasoning. Bias toward fewer objects: recommend only
  what earns its place. "It's harmless in warn mode" is not a reason to create something — an
  unused guard/rule is still cost and noise.
- **Skipped (duplicate)** — the stack already covers it (Step 2 semantic-equivalence check);
  don't create a second one.

The set you draft in Step 4 and apply in Step 5 is **exactly** the Recommended list — nothing
from the other two states leaks in.

## Step 4 — Draft the definitions as YAML

**First, check whether `./agento11y-prod/` already has drafts from an earlier run** (`ls
agento11y-prod/**` if it exists). If it does, **read them before writing** — don't blind-overwrite
(a plain `Write` over an existing file also just errors). Treat a prior draft as a peer proposal:
reconcile rather than replace. If a previous run made a deliberate, well-reasoned choice — e.g.
dropped an email-redaction pattern because "this agent's job is to email people, so redacting
every address is all-false-positive noise" — that judgment is usually right; keep it and fold in
only what's genuinely new. Overwrite a prior draft only when yours is clearly better, and say why.

Write the definitions to a **local scratch directory**, `./agento11y-prod/`
(`evaluators/<id>.yaml`, `rules/<id>.yaml`, `guards/<id>.yaml`). These are **working drafts, not
committed artifacts**: they exist so the developer can review a diff before you apply it, and
their source of truth after apply is the stack, not the repo. Add `agento11y-prod/` to `.gitignore`
(or write under the OS temp dir) so they aren't accidentally committed — they hold the applied
config redundantly and can carry regexes/prompts the repo shouldn't own. They are exactly what
you'll pass to `gcx agento11y <kind> create -f` (for evaluators: `upsert -f`). Use the
**top-level-fields** YAML shape that the `create -f`/`upsert -f` commands expect (not the
`apiVersion/kind/spec` manifest that the `get -o yaml` commands emit — don't round-trip get
output into create).

**Rules and evaluators**: follow the `agento11y` skill's input format exactly. Start an evaluator
from a template (`gcx agento11y templates get <id> -o yaml`), give it your own `evaluator_id`, and
**always include a `version`** — it is required on create (a date like `"2026-07-15"` or a semver
works; existing evaluators use dates). Omitting it fails with `version is required`. Rule starts
enabled at a low `sample_rate`.

**Guards** — the shape the `agento11y` skill omits (`gcx agento11y guards create -f guard.yaml`; the
resource `Kind` is `HookRule`).

> **Hard gate: do not draft a guard until you have captured the exact accepted create-file shape
> from the current `gcx` version.** Run `gcx agento11y guards create --help` and inspect a real
> definition (`gcx agento11y guards get <id> -o yaml`, or `guards list -o yaml`); if none exists, get
> the schema from `--help` / the resource definition. Only then write a guard file.

This skill (not the `agento11y` skill) carries the guard shape, and field names/nesting can drift by
`gcx` version — so the captured shape is the source of truth, not the snippet below. The snippet
is **illustrative only** (verified against gcx v0.4.0: a `transform` guard with `rule_id`,
`enabled`, `priority`, `action_on_fail`, and `transform.patterns[].{id,regex,replacement}` is
accepted as-is). On create the server fills defaults you don't set — notably `selector: all`,
`phase: preflight`, and `short_circuit: false` — so a `guards get -o yaml` right after create
shows more fields than you sent; that's expected, not drift. A guard starts **disabled** and in
**warn**:

```yaml
# ILLUSTRATIVE — confirm fields with `gcx agento11y guards create --help` before use.
# PROD-SETUP DRAFT — creates a STACK-LEVEL guard (HookRule) via gcx agento11y guards create.
# Starts disabled + warn on purpose: watch it on real traffic before enabling / switching to deny.
rule_id: guard.<agent>.<policy>
enabled: false
priority: 10           # lower runs first
action_on_fail: warn   # always draft as warn (see below)
# choose at least one of transform / tool_filter / evaluator_ids:
transform:
  patterns:
    - id: ssn
      regex: "\\b\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}\\b"
      replacement: "[REDACTED:ssn]"
# tool_filter:
#   blocked_names: ["shell_exec", "Bash(*rm*)"]
# evaluator_ids: ["<policy-judge-id>"]
```
`phase` is `preflight` (default) or `postflight`. **Always draft `action_on_fail: warn`, even for
a hard-policy guard** (prompt-injection, deny-list): a first-time `deny` enabled on live traffic
blocks real users on a false positive. A policy-judge guard references an evaluator id (create the
evaluator first); the developer changes it to `deny` only later, after watching the false-positive
rate in warn mode (Step 6). This skill never drafts an enabled `deny` guard.

## Step 5 — Confirm, then apply with `gcx`

> **`upsert`/`create`/`update` write to the stack — never run them before the developer's explicit yes
> (step 2).** The one thing you CAN run before the yes is `evaluators test -f <request>.yaml`,
> which tests a judge config **without persisting it** (pass `kind`, `config`, `output_keys`,
> `generation_id` in the file — no evaluator need exist yet). Use it to tune the judge (step 1).
> There is **no CLI dry-run** for rules or guards — their safety comes from shipping guards
> `disabled` + `warn` and rules at a low `sample_rate`, not from a preview.

Per object the developer wants, in dependency order (evaluators → rules → guards, since a
rule/guard referencing an evaluator needs it to exist first):

1. **For an `llm_judge` evaluator, tune the prompt before creating it — this is the real work,
   not a formality.** A judge is only as good as its prompt, so don't create it on first draft and
   move on. Loop: pick 1–2 real generations you know the right answer for
   (`gcx agento11y generations get <id>`), run the draft config with
   `gcx agento11y evaluators test -f <request>.yaml -g <gen-id>` (tests without persisting), and
   **read both the verdict AND the rationale**. If either disagrees with what you expected, adjust
   the `system_prompt`/`user_prompt` and re-test. Repeat until verdict and rationale both hold on
   your known examples. Only then does the evaluator move to step 2. (This tuning loop deserves its
   own dedicated flow; keep it lightweight here.)
2. **Confirm.** Restate the target stack from Step 0 (context name + server), show the exact YAML,
   and get an explicit yes for that object. A yes for one object is not a yes for the next. Nothing
   is written before this yes.
3. **Apply** via gcx, only after the yes: `gcx agento11y evaluators upsert -f evaluators/<id>.yaml`,
   then `gcx agento11y rules create -f rules/<id>.yaml`, then
   `gcx agento11y guards create -f guards/<id>.yaml`. Evaluators are create-or-update (same id
   updates). Pass `--context <name>` on every call if the confirmed stack isn't the default
   context. gcx handles auth — no tokens here.
   - **`gcx agento11y guards create` does not preserve `enabled: false` / `short_circuit: false` — it stores
     the guard `enabled: true` and `short_circuit: true` regardless of the draft.** This is a known
     `create` quirk, not a draft error, and the `create` command's own echoed output can still show
     the values you sent, so do NOT trust it. After every guard `create`, read the STORED object
     with `gcx agento11y guards get <id> -o yaml` and, if `enabled` came back `true` (it will) or
     `short_circuit` isn't what you drafted, immediately `gcx agento11y guards update <id> -f
     guards/<id>.yaml` to force `enabled: false` (+ your intended `short_circuit`), then `get` again
     to confirm it held. A first-time guard live on traffic is exactly what this skill must never
     ship, so this verify-and-update step is mandatory, not conditional.
   - A judge-model 404 when testing/scoring is usually a stack-side misconfiguration (the stack's
     judge model id is dead), not your evaluator — flag it; the online rule will hit the same broken
     judge at runtime until it's fixed.
4. If `gcx` reports it isn't authenticated, stop and ask the developer to run `gcx login`; do not
   fall back to raw HTTP.

## Step 5.5 — Wire the agent to call the guard (guards only, REQUIRED)

Creating a guard on the stack does **not** make it do anything. Unlike online rules — which the
eval worker applies asynchronously to already-ingested traffic, with zero agent changes — a guard
is a **synchronous request-path policy the agent must call itself**. If the agent never calls the
hooks endpoint, the guard is inert: it exists, shows `enabled`, and never fires. That is also why
Step 6 would show no `warn`s — nothing invoked the guard.

So every guard applied in Step 5 has a matching code change the developer owns. This skill does not
edit or redeploy the agent (see Rules), but it MUST tell the developer exactly what to add, per
guard, or the guard is dead config. Present this as part of the hand-off — don't leave the guard
looking "done" after Step 5.

At each LLM call the agent evaluates the guard via the SDK and honors the verdict. Minimal Python
(`agento11y` >= 0.11):

```python
from agento11y import (
    Client, ClientConfig, ApiConfig, HooksConfig,
    HookEvaluateRequest, HookContext, HookModel, HookInput,
    HookDeniedError, user_text_message,
)

client = Client(config=ClientConfig(
    api=ApiConfig(endpoint="https://<stack>.grafana.net"),  # scheme+host; SDK appends the hooks path
    hooks=HooksConfig(enabled=True, phases=["preflight"], fail_open=False),
))

# preflight: evaluate the INPUT before the LLM call.
# postflight: run it AFTER the call and pass the produced output instead.
resp = client.evaluate_hook(HookEvaluateRequest(
    phase="preflight",
    context=HookContext(
        model=HookModel(provider="anthropic", name="claude-..."),
        agent_name="<the rule's match.agent_name>",
        agent_version="<v>",
        conversation_id=conversation_id,   # REQUIRED to record the guard on the conversation
    ),
    input=HookInput(messages=[user_text_message(prompt)]),   # postflight: output=[assistant_message]
))
if resp.is_deny:
    raise HookDeniedError(reason=resp.reason, rule_id=resp.rule_id,
                          evaluations=list(resp.evaluations))
```

Three gotchas that silently break guards — call each out to the developer:

- **`fail_open=False`** — with the default `True`, a transport error (or a disabled/missing guard)
  resolves to `allow`, so a `deny` never actually blocks. Fail-closed is what makes the guard enforce.
- **`conversation_id` in the context** — without it, a `deny`/`warn` outcome is NOT persisted onto
  the conversation, so it's invisible in the UI and Step 6 has nothing to watch. With it, the server
  records a "Guard: <rule>" workflow step on the conversation.
- **`allow` leaves no trace** — the server persists only `deny` and `warn` outcomes; a clean pass
  records nothing (just a metric). So "no guard step on the conversation" is ambiguous — it means
  either allow OR not-wired. Distinguish them by whether ANY guard step ever appears for that agent.

**Phase choice mirrors the guard:** a guard whose evaluator uses `target: input` is **preflight**
(evaluate `input.messages` before the call — block a bad request before spending tokens); one with
`target: response` is **postflight** (evaluate `input.output` after — catch a bad response). The
rule's `match.agent_name` / `match.model` scopes the guard to this agent; the agent's context must
send the same `agent_name`.

Other SDKs (JS, Go) expose the same `evaluate_hook` / hooks-config shape; check the per-language SDK
reference and verify the exact symbols against the installed `agento11y` package. (As of writing the
canonical `llms.txt` does not yet carry a guard-instrumentation section, so don't defer to it for
this — the shape above is the reference.)

## Step 6 — Summarize and hand off

Output, in this order:

1. The three states from Step 3, kept distinct: **Recommended** (each with its surface, evaluator
   kind, and `why` — file:line or conversation/generation id); **Considered, not recommended**
   (each with its one-line why); **Skipped as duplicates** (what on the stack already covered it).
   Don't move an item between states between Step 3 and here.
2. What was created vs. left as a draft: for each **Recommended** object, the YAML path and whether
   it was applied via gcx. (Considered-not-recommended items were never drafted, so they have no
   path — don't list them here.)
3. The follow-through the developer still owns:
   - **Guards:** first, **wire the agent to call the guard (Step 5.5)** — until that code ships the
     guard is inert and you'll see no `warn`s, no matter how it's configured. State this per guard,
     with the exact call to add. Then watch the `warn` guards on real traffic and flip to `deny` +
     `enabled` only once the false-positive rate looks acceptable —
     `gcx agento11y guards update <id> -f ...`. Both the wiring and the flip are theirs to make, not
     this skill's.
   - **Rules:** raise `sample_rate` once scores look sane and cost is understood
     (`gcx agento11y rules update`); add alerting on regressions if wanted.
   - Inspect everything in Agent Observability (rules/guards/evaluators pages, the conversation
     Quality view) or via the `gcx agento11y` list and get commands.
4. A one-line pointer back: for pre-ship offline evaluation of a new agent or version,
   `agento11y-test-starter` is the counterpart; for control-plane mechanics, the `agento11y` skill.
